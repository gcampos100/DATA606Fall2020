## Grading the professor

Many college courses conclude by giving students the opportunity to evaluate 
the course and the instructor anonymously. However, the use of these student 
evaluations as an indicator of course quality and teaching effectiveness is 
often criticized because these measures may reflect the influence of 
non-teaching related characteristics, such as the physical appearance of the 
instructor. The article titled, "Beauty in the classroom: instructors' 
pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity" by Hamermesh and Parker 
found that instructors who are viewed to be better looking receive higher 
instructional ratings. 

Here, you will analyze the data from this study in order to learn what goes 
into a positive professor evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Load packages

In this lab, you will explore and visualize the data using the **tidyverse** suite of 
packages. The data can be found in the companion package for OpenIntro resources, **openintro**.

Let's load the packages.

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(DATA606)
library(GGally)
data(evals)
```

This is the first time we're using the `GGally` package. You will be using the
`ggpairs` function from this package later in the lab.


### The data

The data were gathered from end of semester student evaluations for a large 
sample of professors from the University of Texas at Austin. In addition, six 
students rated the professors' physical appearance. The result is a data frame 
where each row contains a different course and columns represent variables about 
the courses and professors. It's called `evals`.

```{r}
glimpse(evals)
```

We have observations on 21 different variables, some categorical and some 
numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:

```{r help-evals}
#?evals
```

## Exploring the data

### 1.
	
	Is this an observational study or an experiment? The original research
    question posed in the paper is whether beauty leads directly to the
    differences in course evaluations. Given the study design, is it possible to
    answer this question as it is phrased? If not, rephrase the question.
\
**ANSWER:**\newline
This is an observational studies (no control groups, experimentation. No it is not phrased correctly,\newline
*'Does beauty lead to `higher` (or `lower`) course evaluations for professors.'*\newline
are more appropriate potential questions.

### 2.  
	
	Describe the distribution of `score`. Is the distribution skewed? What does 
    that tell you about how students rate courses? Is this what you expected to 
    see? Why, or why not?
\
**ANSWER:**\newline
The data is left skewed, but for the most part not at the endpoints. This is expected, simply because scores below 3.3 and at or above 4.7 can be viewed as critical of the professor both positively and negatively, and hence would be less likely scores a student would pick in general. This also may imply higher scoring from students on average.

```{r step_1, echo=FALSE,results='hide', include=TRUE}
# Quick plot using vectors. Step on make vector
Q1<-data.frame(prof_id = evals$prof_id,score = evals$score)
Q1

```    

```{r preferred, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE,fig.show='show'}
# Preferred option is to make a dataframe based on the vector above
Q1.1<-Q1 %>% 
  group_by(score) %>%
  summarise(no_rows = length(score))
```

```{r preferred_plot, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, include=TRUE, fig.height=4}
# Use ggplot(),geom_bar(),geom_text(),labs)(),scale_x_continous(), and theme() to edit plot
ggplot(data = Q1.1, aes(x=score, y=no_rows,fill=no_rows)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
	geom_text(aes(label=no_rows),position = position_dodge(width = .1),vjust = -0.25)+
	labs(title = 'Score Distribution',x = 'Score', y="Count")+
	scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(Q1.1$score)) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Option 1 make bar chart with count
Q1_alt<-evals$score
qplot(Q1_alt)+geom_text(stat = 'count',aes(label =..count.., vjust = -0.2), color="blue")
```

```{r hist_evals_count, include=FALSE}
# option 2 for plot
require( lattice ) 
histogram( ~as.factor(Q1_alt))

```

```{r plot_basic_evals_count, include=FALSE}
#option 3
plot( as.factor(Q1_alt),
main="College Professor Scores",
ylab='count',
col='blue')
```    




### 3.  

	Excluding `score`, select two other variables and describe their relationship 
    with each other using an appropriate visualization.\newline
\
**ANSWER:**\newline
I chose Age and `bty_avg` and `age` which is defined by [Open Intro 'eval' data set](www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=evals) as:\newline

* age = Age of professor
* bty_avg = Average beauty rating of professor.


```{r Q3_scatter, echo = FALSE,fig.height=3}
Q3<-data.frame(age = evals$age, bty_avg = evals$bty_avg)
Q3
ggplot(data=Q3,mapping = aes(x = age, y = bty_avg))+
	geom_point()+
	labs(title = 'Age vs. Beauty Scores',x='Age', y="Beauty Scores (avg)")+
	scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(Q3$age)) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4}
boxplot(evals$age, evals$bty_avg)
```

## Simple linear regression

The fundamental phenomenon suggested by the study is that better looking teachers
are evaluated more favorably. Let's create a scatterplot to see if this appears 
to be the case:

```{r scatter-score-bty_avg, fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(data = evals, aes(x = bty_avg, y = score)) +
  geom_point()
```

Before you draw conclusions about the trend, compare the number of observations 
in the data frame with the approximate number of points on the scatterplot. 
Is anything awry?**I think we're missing data**

### 4.

	Replot the scatterplot, but this time use `geom_jitter` as your layer. What 
    was misleading about the initial scatterplot?

```{r scatter-score-bty_avg-jitter,echo = FALSE, fig.height=3}
ggplot(data = evals, aes(x = bty_avg, y = score)) +
  geom_jitter()
```
\    
**ANSWER:**\newline
We definitely were not showing all the data, some rows were missing without use of geom_jitter()

### 5.  

	Let's see if the apparent trend in the plot is something more than
    natural variation. Fit a linear model called `m_bty` to predict average
    professor score by average beauty rating. Write out the equation for the linear 
    model and interpret the slope. Is average beauty score a statistically significant
    predictor? Does it appear to be a practically significant predictor?
    
```{r, fig.height=4}
m_bty <- lm(evals$score~evals$bty_avg)
m_bty
plot(evals$bty_avg~jitter(evals$score),main = 'Beauty Score Trend',sub = 'Linear Model', xlab = 'Scores',ylab = 'Beauty Score Average',col.sub = 'Red', col.lab = 'blue', col='blue',pch=18)
abline(m_bty, col='red')
```

***

\clearpage
    
Add the line of the bet fit model to your plot using the following:
    
```{r scatter-score-bty_avg-line-se, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = evals, aes(x = bty_avg, y = score)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
  
```

The blue line is the model. The shaded gray area around the line tells you about the 
variability you might expect in your predictions. To turn that off, use `se = FALSE`.

```{r scatter-score-bty_avg-line, fig.height=3}
ggplot(data = evals, aes(x = bty_avg, y = score)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

### 6.  

	Use residual plots to evaluate whether the conditions of least squares
    regression are reasonable. Provide plots and comments for each one (see
    the Simple Regression Lab for a reminder of how to make these).
    
```{r Q6, results='show', include=TRUE, out.width="50%"}
plot_ss(x = evals$bty_avg, y = evals$score, showSquares = TRUE)
hist(m_bty$residuals,xlim = c(-2,1),main = "Histogram of Residuals", col = 'light green',xlab = "Residuals")
```

```{r Q6_hist, results show, echo= FALSE, include=TRUE,out.width="50%"}
qqnorm(m_bty$residuals)
qqline(m_bty$residuals)
```

**ANSWER:**\newline

* **Linearity** - Positive & Slightly Linear
* **Nearly Normal residual** - Condition not met histogram left skewed
* **Constant Variability** - Condition met based of residual plot
* **Independent Observations** - Conditions assumed to be met

Not all conditions met, regression method will be rejected.

## Multiple linear regression

The data set contains several variables on the beauty score of the professor: 
individual ratings from each of the six students who were asked to score the 
physical appearance of the professors and the average of these six scores. Let's 
take a look at the relationship between one of these scores and the average 
beauty score.

```{r bty-rel, fig.height=3}
ggplot(data = evals, aes(x = bty_f1lower, y = bty_avg)) +
  geom_point()

evals %>% 
  summarise(cor(bty_avg, bty_f1lower))
```

As expected, the relationship is quite strong---after all, the average score is 
calculated using the individual scores. You can actually look at the 
relationships between all beauty variables (columns 13 through 19) using the 
following command:

```{r bty-rels}
evals %>%
  select(contains("bty")) %>%
  ggpairs()
```

These variables are collinear (correlated), and adding more than one of these 
variables to the model would not add much value to the model. In this 
application and with these highly-correlated predictors, it is reasonable to use
the average beauty score as the single representative of these variables.

In order to see if beauty is still a significant predictor of professor score 
after you've accounted for the professor's gender, you can add the gender term 
into the model.

```{r scatter-score-bty_avg_pic-color}
m_bty_gen <- lm(score ~ bty_avg + gender, data = evals)
summary(m_bty_gen)
```

***
\clearpage


### 7.  

	P-values and parameter estimates should only be trusted if the
    conditions for the regression are reasonable. Verify that the conditions
    for this model are reasonable using diagnostic plots.

* **Linearity** - Condition met.
* **Nearly Normal residual** - Condition met based on `Histogram of m_bty_gen residuals` albiet slighly left skewed
* **Constant Variability** - Condition met based on `m_bty_gen scatter` & `m_bty_gen Variability` Where it is also noted the median are similar and each variable is related to the outcome
* **Independent Observations** - Conditions independence established based on how data was collected

```{r, out.width='50%',echo=FALSE}
qqnorm(m_bty_gen$residuals)
qqline(m_bty_gen$residuals)
plot(m_bty_gen$residuals ~ evals$bty_avg, main = "m_bty_gen scatter",xlab = "Average",ylab = "Residuals", col = "Dark green", pch = 18)
abline(h = 0, lty = 3)
```

```{r, out.width='50%',echo=FALSE}
ggplot(evals,aes(y=m_bty_gen$residuals,x=gender))+geom_boxplot()+geom_point()+
	labs(title = 'm_bty_gen Variability',x = 'Gender', y="Residuals")
hist(m_bty_gen$residuals, main = "Histogram of m_bty_gen residuals", xlab = 'Residuals', col = "Dark red")
```

```{r,echo = FALSE, include=TRUE, out.width='27%'}
plot(m_bty_gen)
```

***

\clearpage

### 8.  

	Is `bty_avg` still a significant predictor of `score`? Has the addition
    of `gender` to the model changed the parameter estimate for `gender`?

**ANSWER:**\newline
Basically, `gender` enhances `bty_avg` more relevant.\newline
P-value for `m_bty$bty_avg` vs `m_bty_gen$bty_avg` is 5.083e-05 > 6.48e-06 supporting this fact.

```{r, results='hide'}
summary(m_bty)
summary(m_bty_gen)
```


Note that the estimate for `gender` is now called `gendermale`. You'll see this 
name change whenever you introduce a categorical variable. The reason is that R 
recodes `gender` from having the values of `male` and `female` to being an 
indicator variable called `gendermale` that takes a value of $0$ for 
female professors and a value of $1$ for male professors. (Such variables 
are often referred to as "dummy" variables.)

As a result, for female professors, the parameter estimate is multiplied by zero,
leaving the intercept and slope form familiar from simple regression.

\[
  \begin{aligned}
\widehat{score} &= \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \times bty\_avg + \hat{\beta}_2 \times (0) \\
&= \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \times bty\_avg\end{aligned}
\]

<!-- We can plot this line and the line corresponding to those with color pictures
with the following  -->
<!-- custom function. -->

<!-- ```{r twoLines} -->
<!-- ggplot(data = evals, aes(x = bty_avg, y = score, color = pic_color)) + -->
<!--   geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE) -->
<!-- ``` -->

### 9.  

	What is the equation of the line corresponding to those with color pictures? 
    (*Hint:* For those with color pictures, the parameter estimate is multiplied
    by 1.) For two professors who received the same beauty rating, which color 
    picture tends to have the higher course evaluation score?

**ANSWER:**\newline
As demonstrated below males tend to have a higher rating of at least 0.17239

\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Estimate\newline
(Intercept) \ \ \ \ \ 3.74734\newline
bty_avg \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0.0741\newline
**gendermale** \ \ 0.17239\newline

**$\therefore$** $B_0$ = 3.74734 and $B_1$ = 0.07416 and noting the details regarding males

* $\hat {score_{male}}$ = 3.74734+0.07416 $\times$ `bty_avg`+0.17239 $\times$ 1 = **3.74734+0.07416 $\times$ `bty_avg`+0.17239**
* $\hat {score_{female}}$= 3.74734+0.07416 $\times$ `bty_avg`+0.17239 $\times$ 0 = **3.74734+0.07416 $\times$ `bty_avg`**


The decision to call the indicator variable `gendermale` instead of 
`genderfemale` has no deeper meaning. R simply codes the category that 
comes first alphabetically as a $0$. (You can change the reference level of a categorical 
variable, which is the level that is coded as a 0, using the`relevel()` function. 
Use `?relevel` to learn more.)

### 10. 

	Create a new model called `m_bty_rank` with `gender` removed and `rank` 
    added in. How does R appear to handle categorical variables that have more 
    than two levels? Note that the rank variable has three levels: `teaching`, 
    `tenure track`, `tenured`.

**ANSWER:** R handles categorical variables in this case by creating 2 more levels:\newline
**ranktenure track** \ -0.16070    0.07395  -2.173   0.0303\newline
**ranktenured** \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ -0.12623    0.06266  -2.014   0.0445 \newline

```{r, results='hide'}
m_bty_rank <- lm(score ~ bty_avg + rank, data = evals)
summary(m_bty_rank)
```
    

The interpretation of the coefficients in multiple regression is slightly 
different from that of simple regression. The estimate for `bty_avg` reflects
how much higher a group of professors is expected to score if they have a beauty
rating that is one point higher *while holding all other variables constant*. In
this case, that translates into considering only professors of the same rank 
with `bty_avg` scores that are one point apart.

## The search for the best model

We will start with a full model that predicts professor score based on rank, 
gender, ethnicity, language of the university where they got their degree, age, 
proportion of students that filled out evaluations, class size, course level, 
number of professors, number of credits, average beauty rating, outfit, and 
picture color.

### 11. 

	Which variable would you expect to have the highest p-value in this model? 
    Why? *Hint:* Think about which variable would you expect to not have any 
    association with the professor score.
    
**ANSWER:**\newline
Based on [Open Intro 'eval' data set](www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=evals) which states:

* **cls_profs** - Number of professors teaching sections in course in sample: single, multiple.

I'd assume this is the variable that would have the highest `p-value` since its least associated with the professor score.

Let's run the model...

```{r m_full, tidy = FALSE}
m_full <- lm(score ~ rank + gender + ethnicity + language + age + cls_perc_eval 
             + cls_students + cls_level + cls_profs + cls_credits + bty_avg 
             + pic_outfit + pic_color, data = evals)
summary(m_full)
```

### 12. 

	Check your suspicions from the previous exercise. Include the model output
    in your response.

**ANSWER:**     
With a `p-value` of 0.5847 I believe my suspicions were correct.
    
```{r, results='hide', fig.show='show',out.width="50%"}
m_a<-lm(score~cls_profs,data=evals)
summary(m_a)
plot(evals$score ~ evals$cls_profs)
```


### 13. 

	Interpret the coefficient associated with the ethnicity variable.
	
**ANSWER:**\newline
Ratings for professors that qualify as "not minority" is higher by 0.1032.

```{r,results='hide', out.width="50%"}
m_c<-lm(score~ethnicity,data=evals)
summary(m_c)
plot(evals$score ~ evals$ethnicity)
```

### 14. 

	Drop the variable with the highest p-value and re-fit the model. Did the
    coefficients and significance of the other explanatory variables change?
    (One of the things that makes multiple regression interesting is that
    coefficient estimates depend on the other variables that are included in
    the model.) If not, what does this say about whether or not the dropped
    variable was collinear with the other explanatory variables?
    
**ANSWER:**\newline
Slight change in coefficients and significance, to where they're all slightly lower, implying more significance.

```{r}
m_d <- lm(score ~ rank + ethnicity + gender + language + age + cls_perc_eval + 
    cls_students + cls_level + cls_credits + bty_avg + pic_outfit + pic_color, 
    data = evals)
summary(m_d)
```


### 15. 

	Using backward-selection and p-value as the selection criterion,
    determine the best model. You do not need to show all steps in your
    answer, just the output for the final model. Also, write out the linear
    model for predicting score based on the final model you settle on.

**ANSWER:**\newline
**$\hat {score}$** = $\hat {\beta_0} +\hat {\beta_1} \times ethnicity\ not\ minority + \hat {\beta_2} \times gender\ male + \hat {\beta_3} \times language\ non-english + \hat {\beta_4} \times age + \hat {\beta_5} \times class\ percent\ evaluations + \hat {\beta_6} \times one\ class\ credit + \hat {\beta_7} \times beauty\ average + \hat {\beta_8} \times colored\ picture$

\

```{r}
m_e <- lm(score ~ ethnicity + gender + language + age + cls_perc_eval 
              + cls_credits + bty_avg 
              + pic_color, data = evals)
summary(m_e)
```

### 17. 

	The original paper describes how these data were gathered by taking a
    sample of professors from the University of Texas at Austin and including 
    all courses that they have taught. Considering that each row represents a 
    course, could this new information have an impact on any of the conditions 
    of linear regression?

**ANSWER:**\newline
I imagine some may question if independence was violated, but I believe the scores given would still be considered independent, so no I do not believe it will make a difference.

### 18. 

	Based on your final model, describe the characteristics of a professor and 
    course at University of Texas at Austin that would be associated with a high
    evaluation score.

**ANSWER:**\newline
A professor with a high percentage for student evaluation in a one-credit class, who is a non-minority, english speaking teacher would get the highest evaluations based on our data.

### 19. 

	Would you be comfortable generalizing your conclusions to apply to professors
    generally (at any university)? Why or why not?
    
**ANSWER:**\newline
I wouldn't simply because this is an observation in a specific region with it's own specific demographics. I would be comfortable with a larger, more diversified data set conducted as an experiment.
